## tg-comp-challenge-1

### Overview
This project is the first of three static comp challenges that require us to build a website with only a comp to guide us. In this specific project, we were only given a comp with no assets. The only requirement was that we stick to the layout. Some creative license was given to us with relation to the copy, images, icons, and the color palette.

In my version of the comp, I decided to go with a Captain America them. I used an image of Captain America (obviously) and preceded to base my color palette off of that image. From there I used flexbox to style my webpage.
